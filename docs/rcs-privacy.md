# Privacy Policy

**User's Privacy is a big deal to us.**

We take care to design our apps to **not** transmit any personal information to any third party servers.

We do not use analytics/tracking libraries in our apps.

For any cloud-storage-enabled apps, we will store data that you choose to store in the cloud, on a third-party database.

For any apps that have authentication/sign-in, the policies of the authentication provider will apply.

For cloud-storage-enabled or authenticated apps, we will only ask for a username and password, or email address to create a user account to which your data is associated.

Offline apps do not have any user sign-in feature and any data collected would only be used within the app and stored on your device, never transmitted from your device to our, or any third-party systems.

Any user-data that we collect is based on the nature of the app, and the same rules apply as above.

We do not capture/store/track usage of the app, nor sell any information to any third-party.

Feel free to reach out to [contact@reset-consulting-services-llc.space](mailto:contact@reset-consulting-services-llc.space) if you have any questions or concerns.
